Private repo for 2018 group design practical

TODO:
- [IMPLEMENT] jumbotron for tweets
- [IMPLEMENT] graphic for probability
- [ACTION]    ask group how tweets will be returned to you
              research first as unlikely they will have ideas
- [CONSIDER]  Loading time display issues
- [CONSIDER]  Look into 1 pager to implement vision
  - Would be one html page
  - JQUERY does post and get requests
  - sexy transitions
  - loading screen
  - How easy to keep going then switch out?
    - transitions impossible with flask
    - loading display solution is same regardless
  - CONCLUSION: last resort

VISION:
- Single search bar, white on black, large hashtag + bar
- hashtag is automatically added even on spacebar
- press enter or hit search, search bar flies up and out, loading symbol flies up and in
- when loaded, black background fades away to reveal white background and results
